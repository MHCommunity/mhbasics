<li>You need to use a lot of Bland Queso as materials for the higher tiered cheese.</li>
</ul>

Pricky Plains:
<ul>
<li>Use ARCONYM, Aqua Base and Bland Queso here.</li>
<li>Using different cheese, you will get leaves for the next tiered cheese.</li>
<ul><li>Using Bland Queso - You get Mild Spice Leaf.</li>
<li>Using Mild Queso - You get Medium Spice Leaf.</li>
<li>Using Medium Queso - You get Hot Spice Leaf.</li>
<li>Using Hot Queso - You get Flamin' Spice Leaf.</li>
<li>Using Flamin' Queso - You get Ember Root.</li></ul>
<li>It is recommended you use Magic Essence to craft Hot, Flamin' and Wildfire.</li>
<li>Continue the cycle until you have at least 40 Flamin' Queso, if you run out of Bland Queso, head back to Queso River to pump more.</li>
<li>Use Flamin' Queso and a good charm (Super/Extreme Snowball Charm) and collect 15 Ember Roots before moving on to Cantera Quarry.</li>
</ul>

Cantera Quarry:
<ul>
<li>Use Interdimensional Crossbow Trap, Aqua Base, Flamin' Queso and a good charm (Super/Extreme Snowball Charm) here.</li>
<li>Collect 12 Ember Roots and 1000 Nachore (Do not upgrade your Pump first).</li>
<li>Buy Overgrown Ember Stone Base (OESB) with 15 Ember Roots, 12 Ember Stones, 1,000 Nachore and 7,800,000 gold.</li>
<li>Change your base to OESB and finish off the rest of your Flamin' Queso here and upgrade your pump. However, do not upgrade your pump past level 6.</li>
</ul>

Claim the Adventure Extinguish Inferna, The Engulfed. Then continue the cycle and focus on getting 1,200 Nachore and buy Fully-Functional Queso Geyser Replica Clay Model from the Cartographer.

For now, your goal would be to collect the 3 traps from the Trapsmith - Scarlet Ember Root Trap (SERT), Blazing Ember Spear Trap (BEST) and Ember Prison Core Trap (EPCT). For the first two traps just repeat the steps listed above to farm Ember Roots, Ember Stones and Nachore. To get Unstable Ember Gadget for EPCT, you would need to catch Queen Quesada.

Queen Quesada - In order to catch her, you would need Wildfire Queso. You would need 25,000 Bland Queso, 10 Ember Roots and 10 Ember Stones for 3 Wildfire Queso. However, you are highly recommended to add 3 Magic Essences to get 6 Wildfire Queso in total. Use S.L.A.C II, OESB, Wildfire Queso and Extreme/Ultimate Snowball Charms to catch Queen Quesada in Queso River, you would need 15 Unstable Gadget so you might need to craft multiple batches of Wildfire Queso.

You can head over to Queso Geyser, once you obtained traps advised.

### Queso Canyon Grand Tour

## Queso Geyser

You are recommended to use BEST and OESB here. You can earn some SUPERBrie+ from sniping in every stage here, check out discord for more info. There are 7 stages in the Queso Geyser:
<ul>
<li>Cork Collecting</li>
<li>Pressure Building</li>
<li>Tiny Eruption - Do not end up here</li>
<li>Small Eruption</li>
<li>Medium Eruption</li>
<li>Large Eruption</li>
<li>Epic Eruption</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Mild: 5 kPa</li>
<li>Medium: 5 - 15 kPa</li>
<li>Hot: 5 - 40 kPa</li>
<li>Flamin: 5 - 100 kPa</li>

<li>Large Eruption: Dragonbane Charm</li>
<li>Epic Eruption: Dragonbane Charm</li>
</ul>

You collect Cork Barks in the Cork Collecting stage, it would be used when you begin heading into each Eruption stage. If you leeched a couple of RQCGT, you should have sufficient Cork Barks to begin the Eruption stages. The higher tiered Queso used here would give you more Cork Barks per hunt, however it is recommended that you do not go higher than Medium Queso.

Small Eruption - Start off by constructing a Small Cork, consuming 10 Cork Barks. You would then enter the Pressure Building stage, in this case you have 10 Hunts to raise the pressure to a maximum of 35 kPa. If you raised the pressure to 35 kPa before the 10 hunts is up, you will enter the Small Eruption immediately. You are recommended to use Medium or Mild Queso during the Pressure Building stage. Once you entered the Eruption stage, continue to hunt with Medium Queso although Mild Queso is acceptable. You can snipe Mild Spicekin, Sizzle Pup (more commonly known as Sizzle Mild) and Smoldersnap during the 10 hunts. At the end of the Eruption, do NOT use a Magic Nest Dust (MND) here. You will be able to collect Congealed Rubber. Repeat this process until you have collected 15 Congealed Rubber to start a Medium Eruption.

Medium Eruption - Start off by constructing a Medium Cork, consuming 30 Cork Barks and 15 Congealed Rubber. You would then enter the Pressure Building stage, in this case you have 25 Hunts to raise the pressure to a maximum of 175 kPa. If you raised the pressure to 175 kPa before the 10 hunts is up, you will enter the Medium Eruption immediately. You are recommended to use Hot or Medium Queso during the Pressure Building stage. Once you entered the Eruption stage, continue to hunt with Hot Queso although Medium Queso is acceptable. You can snipe Bearded Elder, Smoldersnap, Ignatia (BE Trio) and Smoldersnap during the 20 hunts. At the end of the Eruption, do NOT use a Magic Nest Dust (MND) here. You will be able to collect Geyserite. Repeat this process until you have collected 30 Geyserite to start a Large Eruption.

Large Eruption - Start off by constructing a Large Cork, consuming 90 Cork Barks and 30 Geyserite. You would then enter the Pressure Building stage, in this case you have 50 Hunts to raise the pressure to a maximum of 1000 kPa. If you raised the pressure to 1000 kPa before the 50 hunts is up, you will enter the Large Eruption immediately. You are recommended to use Hot or Medium Queso during the Pressure Building stage. Once you entered the Eruption stage, continue to hunt with Flamin' Queso and Wild Tonic. If you use Hot Queso, do NOT use Wild Tonic. You can snipe Cinderstorm and Bruticus, the Blazing (Cinderbrut) during the 40 hunts. At the end of the Eruption, use a Magic Nest Dust (MND) here. You will be able to collect Geyserite. Repeat this process until you have collected 60 Tungsten to start a Epic Eruption.

Epic Eruption - Start off by constructing a Epic Cork, consuming 180 Cork Barks and 60 Tungsten. You would then enter the Pressure Building stage, in this case you have 100 Hunts to raise the pressure to a maximum of 300 kPa. If you raised the pressure to 3000 kPa before the 100 hunts is up, you will enter the Large Eruption immediately. You are recommended to use Wildfire Queso with Wild Tonic although Hot Queso is acceptable during the Pressure Building stage. Once you entered the Eruption stage, hunt with Wildfire Queso until you caught your first Kalor.

Claim the adventure Slay the Geyser Dragon. You will come back and finish the rest of the Epic Eruption when you have better traps in the future. Head onto Gnawnia Rift, if you have not completed the adventure. If you completed Gnawnia Rift adventure, you could stay in the Queso Region to snipe and earn more SB or head over to Sunken City (Optional for progression).
