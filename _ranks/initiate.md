## Harbour

{% include banner.html src="banners/harbour.jpg" alt="Harbour Banner" %}

Full of fresh air and plenty of sunshine, the Harbour seems to attract the types of mice who boast of sea salt in their veins.

### Chapter 4

Use Brie Cheese.

Harbour is the **first** area that mice can **steal** gold, points or extra cheese. This is the norm in most locations but you’ll still gain net profit.

Catch a Pirate Mouse.

Click Begin Search and catch all crew members.

Click Claim Booty to obtain some rewards and A Map Scrap.

Repeat the cycle until all 5 Map Scraps are recovered.

Click Assemble Map to obtain Calm Clearing Map Piece.

Claim the adventure Discover the Harbour’s Secrets.

Continue the cycle for more bounty until you rank up to Journeyman/Journeywoman.

If you have more than 100,000 gold, buy Swiss Army Mouse Trap from Town of Gnawnia Trapsmith. If you have around 200,000 gold, you can consider buying the NVMRC Forcefield Trap instead. Pick up Dehydration Base for 24,000 gold, its an upgrade over the Fan Base you've been using.

Travel to Mountain once you rank up to [Journeyman/Journeywoman](/novice-to-grandmaster/journeyman).
