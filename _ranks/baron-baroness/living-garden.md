# Living Garden

{% include banner.html src="banners/living-garden.jpg" alt="Living Garden" %}

Living Garden "Complex" consists of 3 areas:

- Living Garden
- Lost City
- Sand Dunes

Mice in each location drops a type of Garden Petals or Herbs, which are used to purchase cheese for the next location. Another important loot is Garden Essences. As shown in the Head-Up Display (HUD), there are 9 types of Garden Essences. They are shown in order:

1. Aleth Essence
2. Ber Essence
3. Cynd Essence
4. Dol Essence
5. Est Essence
6. Fel Essence
7. Gur Essence
8. Hix Essence
9. Icuri Essence

Essences can be upgraded to the next tier when crafted with 1 Essence Prism and 3 Essences. This is the only reliable way to obtain the more advanced Garden Essences. Ber Essence or above can also be smashed into the equivalent number of Aleth Essences. For example, Ber Essence can be smashed into 3 Aleth Essence while Cynd Essence can be smashed into 9 Aleth Essence. This does not refund any Essence Prism spent so think twice before upcrafting Garden Essences.

Your first stop will be Living Garden itself. Use a Hydro weapon, Aqua Base and Gouda Cheese here. Buy 10 Blue Double Sponge Charm from the Marketplace. Loot 20 Dewdrops from mice (only available when Blue Double Sponge Charm is armed). Click "Pour" in HUD, this will cause Thirsty Mouse to appear for the next 35 hunts. Thirsty Mouse drops Ber and Cynd Essences. Repeat the cycle until you have looted 90 Dewthief Petals. Purchase 90 Dewthief Camembert from Living Garden Cheese Shoppe directly at 1 Dewthief Petal and 750 gold each. Dewthief Camembert 4-Pack is not worth its cost.

If you have Interdimensional Crossbow Trap, travel to Sand Dunes. If not, travel to Lost City.

Sand Dunes:
Use Interdimensional Crossbow Trap, Aqua base and Dewthief Camembert here. Buy 1 Grubling Bonanza Charm from Marketplace. Catching a mouse with Grubling Bonanza Charm triggers a Grubling Stampede, which otherwise only occurs randomly. Buy 15 Grubling Chow Charm from Sand Dunes Charm Shoppe. During Grubling Stampede, switch to Grubling Chow Charm to attract Grubling Mouse, which drops Cynd Essence. A Grubling Stampede lasts for 15 hunts. Once it has ended, buy another Grubling Bonanza Charm from Marketplace to trigger one again. Repeat the cycle until you have Garden Essences equivalent to 105 Aleth Essence. Then, travel to Living Garden.

Lost City:
Use Droid Archmagus Trap (preferred) or Arcane Capturing Rod of Never Yielding Mystery, Aqua Base and Dewthief Camembert here. Buy 1 Searcher Charm from Lost City Charm Shoppe and use it. Catching a mouse with Searcher Charm dispels the Lost Curse and enables the attraction of Essence Collector Mouse, which can drop Ber Essence and Cynd Essence. Disarm your charm and try to catch a few Essence Collector Mouse.
Cursed Mouse can be attracted after the first 3 hunts at Lost City after dispelling the curse. Any attraction of Cursed Mouse re-ignites the Lost Curse. When the curse is re-ignited, buy 1 Searcher Charm from Lost City Charm Shoppe to dispel the curse again. Repeat the cycle until you have Garden Essences equivalent to 105 Aleth Essence. Then, travel to Living Garden.

Living Garden again:
Upgrade your Garden Essences until you have 5 Dol Essences. Purchase 1 Rift Detector from Living Garden Cartographer.

Claim the adventure Obtain a Rift Detector.

If you have not ranked up to Count/Countess, hunt at Fort Rox to get all 3 traps there - Droid Archmagus Trap, Interdimensional Crossbow Trap and Meteor Prison Core Trap if you donâ€™t have them yet. After that, farm as much gold as possible at Fort Rox until you ranked up to Count/Countess.

Once you have ranked up to [Count/Countess], travel to the Queso River.
