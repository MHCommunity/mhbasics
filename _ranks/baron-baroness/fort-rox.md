# Fort Rox

{% include banner.html src="banners/fort-rox.jpg" alt="Fort Rox Banner" %}

A strange meteor has landed near Claw Shot City, leaving a huge impact crater near the Gnawnian Express rails! This mysterious meteor brings with it a mysterious new breed of mice and their presence threatens the lives of the citizens of Varmint Valley. Around the crater, an encampment of hunters has surrounded these dangerous mice and are setting up a fort to hold them back!

### Chapter 12

You thought the nightmare from the train is over, its not!

Fort Rox is Mousoleum on steriods, the starting is going to be tough but you can do it. Start off by collecting Meteorite Pieces during the Day using S.L.A.C II, Aqua Base and Gouda. Loot 50 Meteorite Pieces, get the Wall Upgrade #1 (Basic Wall) and the Mage Tower Upgrade #1 (Spotlight Enchantment).

Upgrades can only be obtained during the day and upgrades of the same category must be made in order. the effects stacks. Do not turn on your Tower Mana in the Day.

There are 2 types of cheese to be used at night in Fort Rox - Crescent Cheese and Moon Cheese. Crescent Cheese is the "Gouda" and Moon Cheese is the "SuperBrie+" equivalent. You can farm Crescent Cheese and sell them on the Marketplace for some gold if you wish to. It is generally not advised to use Moon Cheese as it is very expensive. Once you have at least 15 Crescent Cheese, you can click "Defend Fort" to enter Night and being your real journey.

Phases of Night

- Night consists of 5 phases
  1. Twilight (35 hunts)
  2. Midnight (25 hunts)
  3. Pitch (10 hunts)
  4. Utter Darkness (25 hunts)
  5. First Light (35 hunts)

Each hunt gets you deeper in Night. However, Failure to Catch (FTC) Nightmancer Mouse extends Night by 3 hunts, which may push you back to a previous phase.

Several events at Night and Dawn cause damage to Wall, as listed in the table below. You are immediately sent back to Day if your Wall has no remaining health or you click “Retreat” during Night.

Any damage to the wall can be repaired using Meteorite Pieces during Day only.

Since Battering Ram Mouse deals 15 damage to wall even when caught, Crescent Cheese or Moon Cheese should be used to prevent its attraction. Attempting to cheap out with Gouda here only leads to unnecessary suffering.

Failure to Attract implies that your bait fails to lure the mice at Night away from wall, thus causing more damage than most Failure to Catch without pillage.
Pillage is shown when you FTC a mouse and the box is red.

Use ACRONYM, Aqua Base along with Crescent or Moon Cheese during the Night phases. Weremice are abundant at Twilight, then become decreasingly common with the progression of Night. They are absent from First Light onwards. Weremice are weak to Shadow weapons and are the main source of Howlite. Cosmic Critters starts appearing at Midnight, then become increasingly common with the progression of Night. They are absent at Dawn. Cosmic Critters are weak to Arcane weapons and are the main source of Bloodstone.

Normally, a Shadow weapon is suggested in Twilight and Midnight while an Arcane weapon is suggested from Pitch onwards. However, Arcane Capturing Rod of Never Yielding Mystery outperforms all Shadow weapons except Reaper’s Perch.

At the beginning, you would not even come close to finishing the entire Night. However, at Night, you can obtain materials to upgrade your Wall, Ballista, Cannon, Moat and Mage Tower, which allow you to last longer at Night and eventually reach Dawn. On your first Night, loot 1 Howlite from Weremice and then retreat. Then get Ballista Upgrade #1: Basic Ballista. If you are extensively using Tower Mana, enter Night, loot 1 Howlite from Weremice again, retreat and then get Mage Tower Upgrade #2: Power Enchantment. Otherwise, this upgrade can be skipped.

You can opt to enter Night with very low wall health by converting all but 1-2 Meteorite Pieces into Crescent Cheese before repairing wall. This is a very intensive and optional way to conserve Meteorite Pieces when you are aiming for Howlite-only upgrades. Otherwise, just prepare enough Crescent Cheese for next run and enter Night again until you get enough resources for an important upgrade.

Loot at least 15 Howlite at Night (you probably need multiple runs) and get Wall Upgrade #2: Howlite Wall. This upgrade should allow you to reach Midnight occasionally. Whenever you have at least 5 Bloodstones, get Cannon Upgrade #1: Small Cannon. Otherwise, get Moat Upgrade #1: Small Moat and then Ballista Upgrade #2: Silver Ballista to help you stay at Midnight onwards. Once you get Cannon Upgrade #1, always stay at Night until running out of wall health instead of retreating for an upgrade.

Continue entering Night for Howlite and Bloodstone and get the following upgrades in order:

1. Cannon Upgrade #2: Power Cannon
2. Moat Upgrade #2: Big Moat
3. Mage Tower Upgrade #3: Healing Enchantment (only if you use Tower Mana extensively)
4. Wall Upgrade #3: Blood Bastion
5. Mage Tower Upgrade #4: Sunsphere Enchantment (only if you use Tower Mana extensively)
6. Cannon Upgrade #3: Energy Cannon
7. Ballista Upgrade #3: Sunsilver Ballista

Once you get Wall Upgrade #3, you should be able to occasionally last through Night and reach Dawn.
When you can consistently reach Dawn, you can opt to start a Fort Rox Treasure Map. It is fairly easy to complete and its slots can be sold on MouseHunt Discord if you wish. It is usually recommended to use Rare Map Dust on the map.

Its chest is the major source of Fort Rox Portal Console or Fort Rox Portal Core, which can be sold on Marketplace or used to purchase Fort Rox Portal Projector.

Dawn, the final stage.

At Dawn, retreating is no longer possible. Dawn Destroyers i.e. Monster of the Meteor and Dawn Guardian Mouse are found instead of Weremice and Cosmic Critters. They are weak to Arcane weapons and are the sole source of Dawn Dust. Each catch of Monster of the Meteor increases damage to the wall upon Failure to Catch of Monster of the Meteor and Dawn Guardian Mouse.

When damage multiplier is below 400%, Super Cactus Charm (available from Marketplace) or Ancient Charm (from mapping) are recommended to boost catch rate. When damage multiplier is at 400% or above or avoiding a pillage would prevent your wall losing all health, Shielding Charm (available from Marketplace) is recommended to stay at Dawn for as long as possible.

Loot 1 Inert Queso Dowsing Rod and at least 50 Dawn Dust from the mice here. Buy Queso Dowsing Rod with 200,000 gold, 1 Inert Queso Dowsing Rod and 50 Dawn Dust.

Claim the adventure Defend Fort Rox from the Monster of the Meteor once you have caught Monster of the Meteor.

After you have obtained Ballista Upgrade #3: Sunsilver Ballista, get Droid Archmagus Trap. Then get Interdimensional Crossbow Trap if you do not have Reaper’s Perch. Animatronic Bird and Silver Bolt required can be looted from Monster of the Meteor or purchased from Marketplace. Do not buy them with Dawn Dust.

If you are very tight on funds, you can skip the two weapons for now but eventually you would have to pick these two up, they would help you in Fiery Warpath and later stages of the game.

After getting the two weapons, you may consider getting Moat Upgrade #3: Silver Moat and then Wall Upgrade #4: Moonbeam Fortress. They are however optional if you don’t plan to stay at the area.

At Fort Rox General Store, extra Howlite can be converted to Meteorite Pieces while extra Bloodstone can be converted to Tower Mana. If you have obtained at least 3 Train Badges from Gnawnian Express Station, better conversion rates are available. At Fort Rox Cheese Shoppe, extra Dawn Dust can be converted to Sunrise Cheese.

Optional but recommended:
Continue to do multiple runs till you collected an addtional 100 Dawn Dust for the Fort Rox portal. Buy it from the Cartographer with 100 Dawn Dust, 1 Fort Rox Portal Console and 1 Fort Rox Portal Core. You would then use the portal in Dawn. You would need Sunrise cheese for this step, you can buy it from the Cheese Shoppe but it is recommended that you get it one by one from the Marketplace.

Only use the portal when you have enough gold to buy 10 Sunrise Cheese from the Marketplace, however do not buy all 10 immediately, buy it one by one. Once you used the portal, you will face the Heart of the Meteor (HOTM). Everytime you attract HOTM, it gets weaker and weaker hence easier to catch. You could use an Ultimate Charm here, but it is recommended that you just buy more Sunrise cheese instead. After capturing the HOTM, you will receive Meteoric Core Fragments. Use it along with 60 Howlite and 10 Bloodstone to buy the Meteor Prison Core Trap (MPCT). It is a useful trap for future regions as well.

Travel to Fiery Warpath once you are done with Fort Rox.
