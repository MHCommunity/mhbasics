# Fiery Warpath

{% include banner.html src="banners/fiery-warpath.jpg" alt="Fiery Warpath" %}

The Marching Flame has attacked and pillaged much of the Sandtail Desert and now their warpath is headed towards Gnawnia! Their battalions attack in waves and seem to endlessly march over the horizon. All that stands between them and conquering Gnawnia are the brave hunters who camp here.

Once you’ve traveled to the Fiery Warpath, which is the first area of the Sandtail Desert region, you will notice the extensive HUD (heads up display). In much the same way as the Tower or the Iceberg, the Warpath features a unique game mechanic which makes it very interesting and somewhat difficult during the first visit.

The Warpath consists of 4 Waves. Each Wave consists of a given number of mice that you have to defeat. Warrior, Archer and Scout are present in all waves. There are also Calvary, Mage and Flame Ordnance Mouse which appear at the later waves. The table below shows the primary and secondary weakness of each type.

- Warrior: Primary - Physical
- Archer: Primary - Physical
- Scout: Primary - Physical
- Calvary: Primary - Tactical, Secondary - Physical
- Mage: Primary - Hydro, Secondary - Physical
- Flame Ordnance Mouse: Primary - Arcane, Secondary - Physical

You are recommended to have the following traps

- Physical: Enraged Rhinobot
- Tactical: HVMT
- Hydro: Steam Laser Mk. I
- Shadow: ICT

The core mechanics of the area is streaking. Streaks can be achieved more easily by buying and arming special Warpath Charms, either regular ones or those strengthened by Magic Essence. These Charms will help attract a certain type of mouse, but they can fail in doing so. Catching any different mouse type, FTCs or FTAs will break a Streak.

- A Streak of *3* causes *2* mice of the same class to retreat
- A Streak of *6* causes *4* mice of the same class to retreat
- A Streak of *9* causes *6* mice of the same class to retreat

Tips

- Use (Empowered) SuperBrie+ to avoid Fail to Attracts (FTA),
- Buy the (Super) Variant Charms from the Charm Shoppe to assist in streaking,
- Use (Super) Warpath's Commander Charms to clear the Wave faster.

Leaving the Warpath by traveling somewhere else will NOT reset your progress, even Streaks will remain untouched and waiting for you when you return.

There is also a group of "Special" Mice found in the Warpath. These are mice that are not of the same type as the other mice in the Warpath. They are affected by the following:

- Crimson Commander Mouse
  - Primary weakness - Physical
  - Catching a Crimson Commander Mouse causes a number of mice from each class not yet fully defeated to retreat, equal to the current streak (or 1 in the absence of streak). The streak would also be broken. Using (Super) Warpath's Commander Charm increase the Attraction Rate of encountering it.
- Caravan Guard Mouse
  - Primary weakness - Physical
  - Failing to catch a Caravan Guard adds more mice to a Wave, one for each type of mouse. Although if you have friends in the same area, sometimes they are able to prevent Caravan Guards from doing so. If a certain type of mouse has been already extinguished from the Wave, Caravan Guards do not re-mobilize them or cause more to appear.
- Gargantuamouse
  - Primary weakness - Draconic
  - It may be encountered on a Streak of 7 or above. The chance of attracting Gargantuamouse increases with longer Streak and can be guaranteed by using Gargantua Charm (available from Marketplace) on a Streak of 7 or above. Catching it resets the Streak. You can earn some SuperBrie+ by offering to snipe this mouse for people on Discord.

Recommended Setup:

- Weapon: Enraged Rhinobot
- Base: Aqua Base
- Cheese: SuperBrie+ > Gouda > Brie

Wave 1

- Wave 1 consist of 35 Desert Soldier Mouse (Warrior), 35 Vanguard Mouse (Scout) and 35 Desert Archer Mouse (Archer).
- It is not recommended to use Warpath’s Commander Charm in Wave 1 unless you have a lot of them.
- It is recommended to focus on clearing individual classes before moving on to the next one.
- Crimson Commander Mouse and Caravan Guard Mouse retreats once there are 10 or fewer mice left to clear.

Wave 2

- Wave 2 consists of 40 Flame Warrior Mouse (Warrior), 40 Sentinel Mouse (Scout), 40 Flame Archer Mouse (Archer), 45 Sand Cavalry Mouse (Cavalry) and 20 Inferno Mage Mouse (Mage).The introduction of the 2 new classes makes this wave more difficult than Wave 1. They are also harder to catch than Warrior, Scout and Archer mice.
- Cavalry and Mage mice each drop Desert Horseshoe and Heatproof Mage Cloth respectively,which can be crafted into (Super) Warpath Cavalry/Mage Charm. You can also buy the charms from the Marketplace, this is highly recommended if this is your first run.
- Crimson Commander Mouse and Caravan Guard Mouse retreats once there are 18 or fewer mice left to clear.
- The recommended order for clearing Wave 2 is: Warrior, Scout, Archer, Cavalry, Mage.

Wave 3

- Wave 3 consists of 50 Crimson Titan Mouse (Warrior), 50 Crimson Watch Mouse (Scout), 50 Crimson Ranger Mouse (Archer), 30 Magmarage Mouse (Mage), 60 Sandwing Cavalry Mouse (Cavalry) and 20 Flame Ordnance Mouse (Artillery).
- Wave 3 is similar to Wave 2 with the addtion of Flame Ordnance Mouse. There is no class-specific charm for them.
- Crimson Commander Mouse and Caravan Guard Mouse retreats once there are 26 or fewer mice left to clear.
- The recommended order for clearing Wave 3 is: Warrior, Scout, Archer, Cavalry, Mage, Artillery.

Wave 4

- Wave 4 consists of 12 Theurgy Warden Mouse and 1 Warmonger Mouse. Streaks do not apply in Wave 4.
- You can choose not to use SuperBrie+ here and use Brie/Gouda instead.
- Warmonger Mouse is invulnerable until all 12 Theurgy Warden Mouse are cleared.
- Once you cleared 12 Theurgy Warden Mouse, swtich to your highest power base.
- Catching Warmonger Mouse ends Wave 4 and rewards you with 1 Warpath Victory. You then start over with Wave 1.
- On the first run, Warmonger Mouse always drops 1 Oasis Bead, 1 Sphynx Crystal or 1 Sandblasted Metal, which are one of the components needed to craft three fairly powerful but expensive weapons. After the first run, these loot are much rarer.
- You can earn some SuperBrie+ by offering to snipe this mouse for people on Discord.

Advice on what to do with your first loot from Warmonger:

- Oasis Bead - Sell it on the Marketplace.
- Sphynx Crystal - Sell it on the Marketplace.
- Sandblasted Metal - Wait for me to update this when FF launches.

Travel to Muridae Market after catching Warmonger Mouse.
