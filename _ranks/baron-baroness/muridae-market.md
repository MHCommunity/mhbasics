# Muridae Market

{% include banner.html src="banners/burnt-muridae-market.jpg" alt="Burnt Muridae Market" %}

This fortified market has been ravaged by the relentless attacks of the Marching Flame. Local merchants are eagerly seeking the help of hunters to find construction materials and help rebuild their shops.

You are here to be a good citizen of the Kingdom and rebuild all the shoppes in the region. Use Enraged Rhinobot, Aqua Base or Remote Detonator Base and Brie/Gouda for the area. Hunting mice in the area drops the materials you need to rebuild the shops. Using SuperBrie+ attracts the Desert Architect Mouse, dropping more materials. However, it is usually not worth the cost.

It is advised to get some Artisan Charm with King's Credit. If you have Aristan Charm, hunt with it to get enough materials for the Cartographer, if not follow the guide below.

King's Credit | You can buy some Artisan Charm. Arming Artisan Charm enables you to attract Blacksmith Mouse and Mage Weaver Mouse, both dropping more materials compared to the rest. Artisan Charm also prevents the attraction of the Desert Nomad Mouse.
