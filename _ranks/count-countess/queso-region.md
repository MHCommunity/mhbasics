## Queso River
{% include banner.html src="banners/queso-river.jpg" alt="Queso River Banner" %}

A free-flowing river of Bland Queso with an unknown origin. Being located deep within a canyon has kept it safe and hidden for quite sometime. Pumps established here can pump the Bland Queso straight from the river.

### Chapter 13

Queso Part 1 consist of 3 Areas - Queso River, Prickly Plains and Cantera Quarry. You can earn some SUPERBrie+ from sniping in every area here, check out discord for more info.

Queso River

- Use S.L.A.C II, Aqua Base and Gouda here.
- When you hunt here, you will be pumping Bland Queso. The number of Bland Queso you get per catch is dependant on your Pump level (Upgradable with materials from Cantera Quarry).
  - Level 1: 1 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 2: 2 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 3: 5 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 4: 7 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 5: 12 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 6: 30 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 7: 40 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 8: 60 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 9: 150 Bland Queso per Catch.
  - Level 10: 200 Bland Queso per Catch.
- You can buy Queso Pump Charm from the Marketplace to increase the rate of pumping Bland Queso.
- You need to use a lot of Bland Queso as materials for the higher tiered cheese.

Pricky Plains

- Use ARCONYM, Aqua Base and Bland Queso here.
- Using different cheese, you will get leaves for the next tiered cheese.
  - Using Bland Queso - You get Mild Spice Leaf.
  - Using Mild Queso - You get Medium Spice Leaf.
  - Using Medium Queso - You get Hot Spice Leaf.
  - Using Hot Queso - You get Flamin' Spice Leaf.
  - Using Flamin' Queso - You get Ember Root.
- It is recommended you use Magic Essence to craft Hot, Flamin' and Wildfire.
- Continue the cycle until you have at least 40 Flamin' Queso, if you run out of Bland Queso, head back to Queso River to pump more.
- Use Flamin' Queso and a good charm (Super/Extreme Snowball Charm) and collect 15 Ember Roots before moving on to Cantera Quarry.

Cantera Quarry

- Use Interdimensional Crossbow Trap, Aqua Base, Flamin' Queso and a good charm (Super/Extreme Snowball Charm) here.
- Collect 12 Ember Roots and 1000 Nachore (Do not upgrade your Pump first).
- Buy Overgrown Ember Stone Base (OESB) with 15 Ember Roots, 12 Ember Stones, 1,000 Nachore and 7,800,000 gold.
- Change your base to OESB and finish off the rest of your Flamin' Queso here and upgrade your pump. However, do not upgrade your pump past level 6.

Claim the Adventure Extinguish Inferna, The Engulfed. Then continue the cycle and focus on getting 1,200 Nachore and buy Fully-Functional Queso Geyser Replica Clay Model from the Cartographer.

For now, your goal would be to collect the 3 traps from the Trapsmith - Scarlet Ember Root Trap (SERT), Blazing Ember Spear Trap (BEST) and Ember Prison Core Trap (EPCT). For the first two traps just repeat the steps listed above to farm Ember Roots, Ember Stones and Nachore. To get Unstable Ember Gadget for EPCT, you would need to catch Queen Quesada.

Queen Quesada - In order to catch her, you would need Wildfire Queso. You would need 25,000 Bland Queso, 10 Ember Roots and 10 Ember Stones for 3 Wildfire Queso. However, you are highly recommended to add 3 Magic Essences to get 6 Wildfire Queso in total. Use S.L.A.C II, OESB, Wildfire Queso and Extreme/Ultimate Snowball Charms to catch Queen Quesada in Queso River, you would need 15 Unstable Gadget so you might need to craft multiple batches of Wildfire Queso.

You can head over to Queso Geyser, once you obtained traps advised.

### Queso Canyon Grand Tour

## Queso Geyser

This is the second part of the Queso region.

You are recommended to use BEST and OESB here. You can earn some SUPERBrie+ from sniping in every stage here, check out discord for more info. There are 3 stages in the Queso Geyser

- Cork Collecting
- Pressure Building

You collect Cork Barks in the Cork Collecting stage, which will be used in every Eruption you attempt. Cork is pushed into the Geyser, allowing pressure to be built up, which eventually results in an eruption. If you leeched a couple of RQCGT, you should have sufficient Cork Barks to begin the Eruption stages. The higher tiered Queso used here will give you more Cork Barks per hunt, however it is not recommended to hunt with anything higher than Medium Queso due to how difficult it is to obtain higher tiered cheese.
