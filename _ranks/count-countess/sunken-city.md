Dive into the depths of the Rodentia Ocean and explore this ancient underwater city! Great treasures await adventurous hunters who journey into the deep waters!

### Still Chapter 13 Somehow

You've choosen the path not often choosen. Well done i guess.

Sunken City is split into 2 parts, the first is the Docked Stage, the second is the Dive.

## First Stage

When you first start out in the area, you will be at the Docked Stage. Your goal during the Docked Stage is to collect Oxygen from the mice. Continue hunting with your best Hydro Trap (Steam MK III or Queso Fount Trap), OESB. Consider getting Oxygen Burst Charm from the Marketplace, if not you can choose to use any catch rate charm. Collect around 200 Oxygen before taking your first dive.

Start diving and hunting as per normal to collect Materials for the Fishy Formage namingly, Barnacle, Mouse Scale and Damaged Coral Fragments. Once your 200 Oxygen runs out, craft all the Fishy Formage and use them to hunt at the Docked Stage to collect even more Oxygen.

## Second Stage

Collect 600-1000 Oxygen before diving again. You can choose to buy Smart Water Jet Charms from the Marketplace to speed up your progress but do take note it is very expensive. During your dives, you might encounter Treasury Zones (Dark Yellow Dot), consider using (Golden) Anchor Charms in Sand Dollar Sea Bar, Pearl Patch and Sunken Treasure.

Once you crossed 10,000 metres, look out for the Monster Trench (MT) and the Lair of the Ancients (Lota). Use Empowered Anchor Charm in MT and it is recommended you get Ultimate Anchor Charm in Lota. Claim the adventure Explore the Sunken City when you caught your first Tritus Mouse.

You can continue your dive, looking for more Sunken Treasure to get more Sand Dollars for your Rune Shark and School of Shark afterwards but you could wait for events to get them easier (Great Winter Hunt and Spring Egg Hunt). It is recommended that you skip Tidal Base as a purchase.
