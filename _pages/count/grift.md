## Gnawnia Rift
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Within the depths of the unknown, creeping among the mists of mystery, the Gnawnia Rift is haunted by the most menacing, terrifyingly thought-bending, and maniacally mind-warping mice one could imagine... What will you find beyond the tear is vast and unknown. Brace yourselves for a challenge of great proportions!

### Still Chapter 13

A rift has torn through the fabric of reality and opened up the way into a weird place made of reddish-purple clouds. You're in for a ride here.

Use Sphynx Wrath, Overgrown Ember Stone Base and Chrome Charms here. Buy Brie String Cheese from the Cheese Shoppe. Continue hunting until you have collected 10 Riftiago Potions. Convert your Brie String Cheese into Riftiage Cheese, the Magical String Cheese option is NOT worth it.

Hunt with Riftiago Cheese until you've collected 15 of Magic Seeds, Riftgrass and Rift Dust. Continue the cycle until you met the requirements.

Craft 5 batches of Resonator Cheese (4 Piece) with:
<ul>
<li>3 Magic Seeds</li>
<li>3 Riftgrass</li>
<li>3 Rift Dust</li>
<li>1 Rift Curd - Buy from the General Store</li>
<li>1 Ionised Salt - Buy from the General Store</li>
</ul>

Now hunt with Resonator Cheese for Goliath Field mouse. Once you've caught it, it will drop a Raw Rift Crystal, use the Rift Crystal to buy Crystal Tower, found in the Trapsmith for 4,900,000 gold. The area gets easier from this point onwards, equip Crystal Tower and hunt out the rest of your Riftiago and Resonator Cheese, if you still have some left.

Claim the adventure Capture the Goliath Field Mouse. Head onto the Queso Region, if you have not completed the adventure. If you completed both Queso's adventure, you could stay in the Queso Region to snipe and earn more SB or head over to Sunken City (Optional for progression).
