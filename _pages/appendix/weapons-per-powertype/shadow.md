Shadow, as a powertype, has become quite the shadow of its former self. It starts in the Mousoleum, followed by a number of guest appearances in areas that don't warrant a trap upgrade and culminating in the Hollow Heights. Eventually, it culminates in the Chrome Temporal Turbine, which blasts mice into the sun.
