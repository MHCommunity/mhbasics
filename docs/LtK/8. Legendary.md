This small island was once attached to the mainland before a mighty storm washed away a massive piece of land. Members of the three tribes were then trapped where they were forced to work together to build a means of travel back to the mainland. Cape Clawed now acts as a meeting place where the elders of the tribes discuss diplomatic matters.
