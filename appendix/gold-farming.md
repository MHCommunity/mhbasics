# Goldfarming

## An Intoduction.
As you would expect, this game has a currency that is quite needed. It is conveniently called 'Gold' and is rewarded for each mouse you catch. At a lot of points in the game, this Gold will be the limiting factor for you to progress, and grinding it out is for most not that enjoyable. Thankfully, there are many ways to get Gold. As expected, more energy-intensive or knowledge requiring methods of farming gold also tend to be more lucrative, and better paths tend to become available at higher ranks as well.  
This page contains stubs, most of them deserving their own page as well. The development of these pages will happen over time.

### Structure
All methods mentioned on this page will have the following structure, to make them easily interpretable and making it easier for people to check what pages they want to read more details on:
**Title:** will have the minimum and the maximum title where this method is recommended. Minimum is where it becomes available, and maximum is where an alternative would become available that beats it in the same category.
**Profitability:** Anything mentioned on this page will be profitable and optimal for some category of play, but this doesn't mean methods can't be compared on direct Gold gain. This is expressed in a very low-very high scale.
**Time:** Some strategies require quite the dedication to really shine. This indicates how often you can expect a 'payout'. Very slow methods like markethunting can take months, whereas just hunting good mice for gold will pay you out immediately.
**Intensity:** Intensity is a combination of two factors, but essentially comes down to activity. How much effort are you willing to put into reading up on things? Following the 'news'? Interacting with people for snipe jobs? Most of this will simply be how much you are willing to interact with people while playing a pseudo-idle game, but everyone likes to play differently. This is probably the most important factor to look at, to find a strategy that fits **YOUR** playstyle.

## The earlygame: Novice to Knight
Up untill lord is what is considered the "earlygame". Unfortunately, this section of the game is the least connected to regions of interest for lategame players, giving it the least variety in gold farming. A general important note for this section is to always be on the lookout for freebies on the Facebook page, Feedback Friday and any other source you might find. While these usually aren't massive, they can help a significant chunk with some of the earlygame traps if you're lucky.
