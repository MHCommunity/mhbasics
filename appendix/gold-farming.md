# Goldfarming

## An Intoduction.
As you would expect, this game has a currency that is quite needed. It is conveniently called 'Gold' and is rewarded for each mouse you catch. At a lot of points in the game, this Gold will be the limiting factor for you to progress, and grinding it out is for most not that enjoyable. Thankfully, there are many ways to get Gold. As expected, more energy-intensive or knowledge requiring methods of farming gold also tend to be more lucrative, and better paths tend to become available at higher ranks as well.  
This page contains stubs, most of them deserving their own page as well. The development of these pages will happen over time.

### Structure
All methods mentioned on this page will have the following structure, to make them easily interpretable and making it easier for people to check what pages they want to read more details on:
**Title:** will have the minimum and the maximum title where this method is recommended. Minimum is where it becomes available, and maximum is where an alternative would become available that beats it in the same category.
**Profitability:** Anything mentioned on this page will be profitable and optimal for some category of play, but this doesn't mean methods can't be compared on direct Gold gain. This is expressed in a very low-very high scale.
**Time:** Some strategies require quite the dedication to really shine. This indicates how often you can expect a 'payout'. Very slow methods like markethunting can take months, whereas just hunting good mice for gold will pay you out immediately.
**Intensity:** Intensity is a combination of two factors, but essentially comes down to activity. How much effort are you willing to put into reading up on things? Following the 'news'? Interacting with people for snipe jobs? Most of this will simply be how much you are willing to interact with people while playing a pseudo-idle game, but everyone likes to play differently. This is probably the most important factor to look at, to find a strategy that fits **YOUR** playstyle.
### General gold method #1: Markethunt
**DISCLAIMER: Markethunting is technically available at any rank, but is not recommended untill you have a starting point of both resources and knowledge. It is also risky, so markethunt at your own risk.** 
**Title:** Any, but requires a starting amount of money  
**Profitability:** Potentially very high, but risky
**Time:** Quite fast / Extremely slow
**Intensity:** Ludicrously high
'Markethunt' is the term used for using the 'market' in some way to gain profit. You can look at it as betting on crypto, but then in mousehunt. Knowing trends, like what happens around Ronza's arrival and the start of events, can give you a big edge, but nothing is certain to repeat. This makes long-term markethunting extremely risky, even with the profit it can provide.
There is a subset of markethunting that has a faster payout with both lower profit margins and lower risk. Here, you target the differences between the in-game marketplace and the community marketplaces (like on the Discord server). Often, there are minor differences in prizes between these two, which can be used to intentionally sell something on the more profitable side of the two. If the gap in price is large enough you can even buy/sell Super|BRIE+, the conventional community currency, to continue buying on one side and selling on the other.

## The earlygame: Novice to Knight
Up untill lord is what is considered the "earlygame". Unfortunately, this section of the game is the least connected to regions of interest for lategame players, giving it the least variety in gold farming. A general important note for this section is to always be on the lookout for freebies on the Facebook page, Feedback Friday and any other source you might find. While these usually aren't massive, they can help a significant chunk with some of the earlygame traps if you're lucky.
### Earlygame#0: Runny Cheese
**Title:** variable
**Profitability:** Depending on market
**Time:** Depending on market
**Intensity:** Very low / depending on market
The earlygame has very few places where the Marketplace could be used for profit. The one place where it could, is when farming Runny cheese to sell. How much money this makes depends entirely on the market and your setup, but maybe it makes you a quick buck?

### Earlygame#1: The Mousoleum
**Title:** Master to Legendary
**Profitability:** (Very) Low, but the best available for the rank.
**Time:** Very fast
**Intensity:** average to low
The Mousoleum is the first area in the game that requires Shadow weapons, and fitting to this shady area also provides a solid source of income. The core behind the Mousoleum as a gold source is abusing how profitable Crimson Cheese and Mousevina herself are. When farming gold for the S.S. Huntington IV, the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M., some early Tatical/Hydro traps and the Bot-line physical weapons.

### Earlygame#2: Derr Dunes
**Title:** Legendary to Lord (and potentially beyond)
**Profitability:** decent, but the best available for the rank.
**Time:** Very fast
**Intensity:** average to low
The Derr Dunes got their name from how many Rred boxes it generated. Since then the mice have been made easier, but even back in those days Derr was the best place to get gold by a wide margin. The general concept is very similar to the Mousoleum's goldfarming: whack mice, cycle to 'bosses', get money.

### Earlygame#3: ?????????????

## The midgame: Lord to Duke
The exact lines of what is considered 'early', 'mid' and 'lategame' in Mousehunt are not that defined, but when it comes to farming gold, Lord is a massive milestone. A number of mechanics that are barely (if at all) present before Lord start becoming available all of a sudden
