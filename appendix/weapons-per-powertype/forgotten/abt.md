### General Info and Trivia
The Ancient Box is an ancient box. Tomorrow is another day to be creative.

### Alternatives
Technically speaking, the Ancient Box Trap has an alternative, but this alternative is the most forgotten weapon in the game for a reason. The Forgotten Pressure Plate can be bought from the shop in Bristle Woods, but is significantly worse and requires a number of Runes to purchase. This makes the weapon very far from worthwhile, in comparison to the Ancient Box Trap that you essentially pick up 'along the way'. It's one very small strong point is that it is available slightly earlier for purchase, but by the time you have the resources to actually buy it you should just pick up the ancient box anyway.

### Upgrades
The Ancient Box Trap is a good forgotten weapon for a long time, because you'll be able to forget that it exists for an equally long time. After using it to catch your first Acolyte (and optionally first Eclipse, very optional but 'because I have to'-shoutout to Balack for being even worse), it gets put back on the shelf for an extended period of time. By the time you need it again, you'll already have picked up the next forgotten trap: the [Scarlet Ember Root Trap](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/forgotten/sert)
