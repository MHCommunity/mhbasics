### General Info and Trivia
The Scarlet Ember Root Trap is a relatively recent addition to the game, released alongside Queso Canyon with as main purpose smoothing out the transition from the old forgotten to the lategame forgotten content. At the time, there was no (non-LE) forgotten weapon between the Ancient Box Trap and the Fungal Cavern at Duke, which also required some forgotten action. While using the ancient box here, an upgrade inbetween was more than welcome, making the transition into the Endless Labyrinth Trap a lot more convenient.
