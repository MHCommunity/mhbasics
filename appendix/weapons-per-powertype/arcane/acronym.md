### Weapon Acquisition
The A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. can be bought from the Trapsmith in the Bristle Woods areas for 632,700 gold, 1 Onyx Stone, 12 Scrap Metal, 3 Magic Essence and 1 Obelisk Parts.
- Onyx Stones can be looted from the Dojo Sensei, by using Rumble Cheese in the Pinnacle Chamber.
- Scrap Metal is dropped by many mice, including but not limited to Hydra mice in the Lagoon and Steel mice (which drops one guaranteed when using the Digby Drillbot). The latter is the current recommended route to farm it.
- Magic Essence can be acquired by using the Hunter's Hammer on SUPER|brie+.
- Obelisk Parts can be acquired by smashing either the Obelisk of Slumber or the Obelisk of Incineration. The former is recommended because it is cheaper and a component of the latter.

### General Info and Trivia
The A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is the acronym for the Arcane Capturing Rod Of Never Yielding Mysteries, which is an unwieldy name to use so the acronym is used more commonly in the community.  
The A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is the first meaningful Arcane weapon a hunter will pick up. It is primarily used in Bristle Woods while a hunter works their way towards the Ancient Box Trap, and utterly dominates Fort Rox. While Fort Rox is intended to be a multi-trap type area, the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is simply so powerful that it can beat the intended power types at all stages it has to offer unless some powerful charms or auras are added to the mix.


### Alternatives
The A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. doesn't have any alternatives. The Obelisk of Incineration is a worse version of it, but considering there is no major difference in cost and both can be acquired in the same region, there is no justification for going this route.

## Upgrades
The usual route to upgrading the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is heading towards Fort Rox to pick up the [Droid Archmagus Trap](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/arcane/dat). There is an alternative route that prioritises Sandtail Desert over Varmint Valley where the Grand Arcanum Trap is picked up.
