Arcane, the powertype of the slightly less old, slightly less sinister but still old and sinister and magical weapons. The lines may be a bit blurry at times, but isn't it fitting that you'd need the education of a wizard to figure out the essence of the Arcane?
This powertype starts off somewhere in the middle of the earlygame, first being featured in the Bristle Woods. The first weapon that really matters is the Arcane Capturing Rod Of Never Yielding Mysteries (or A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. if you prefer the acronym), arguably one of the most cost-efficient weapons in the entire game. Just like shadow, its path carries through either the living garden complex or Fort Rox, to then pass through the Queso Canyon and head to the Hollow Heights where it ends in the Floating Islands with the Circlet of Seeking.

Arcane has had a number of oddities with its previous best in slot weapon, but these have thankfully blown over by now. The [Event Horizon Trap](/appendix//weapons-per-powertype/arcane/eht) , which can be picked up from the Labyrinth, used to have two Limited Edition upgrades that were only available during the 2016 and 2017 Great Winter Hunt. These parts not being permanently in the game made Arcane a bit weird, but this oddity was thankfully overcome by the introduction of the Floating Islands.
