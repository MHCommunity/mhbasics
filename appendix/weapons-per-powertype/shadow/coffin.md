### Alternatives
This weapon is already an alternative, to the  [Bottomless Grave](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/shadow/bg).
### Upgrades
After the Creepy Coffin Trap, there are a number of potential weapons to go for. Shadow is in a bit of an awkward spot because it is quite underused or avoidable for a sizeable chunk of the game. The go-to upgrade after the bottomless grave is often the [Interdimensional Crossbow Trap](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/shadow/IDCT).
An in-between traps that can be considered is the [Clockapult of Time](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/shadow/CoT). This upgrade is considered optional because it's use is quite minor. The only places it would be used in are a low number of hunts in the Jungle of Dread and in the Seasonal Garden to acquire a map piece. The next expected use would be in Fort Rox, however the Arcane ACRONYM beats it in catch rate here. Because of this, the Clockapult is considered unnecceseary.
