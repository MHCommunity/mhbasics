### Weapon Acquisition
The Interdimensional Crossbow can be purchased from the Trapsmith in Fort Rox for 5,360,000 gold, 10 silver bolts, 25 bloodstone and 100 howlite.  
- Howlite and Bloodstone are two of the core resources of Fort Rox, dropping during the night. A hunter will likely be more aware of these items after going through Fort Rox.
- Silver Bolts can be purchased from the Fort Rox General Store for 50 dawn dust and the Marketplace. It also can be dropped by the Monster of the Meteor during Fort Rox' Dawn stage and the Heart of the Meteor. The conventional approach to acquiring these is using either the marketplace or farming up the needed dawn dust. 

### general info or trivia
The Interdimensional Crossbow is Fort Rox' shadow weapons and the second "must-get" shadow weapon. It is primarily used in Fort Rox itself, the Sand Dunes, Canterra Quarry and sometimes Moussu Picchu.
There is a different weapon on a similar level as the Crossbow in the Clockwork Portal. The reason it is not further mentioned in this guide is because it is a direct side-grade that is considered significantly more difficult to get. Additonally, the Crossbow can be acquired with minimal Shadow usage, whereas the Clockwork Portal does require quite a bit of hunting with Shadow weapons.
Before the release of Fort Rox, the Clockwork Portal was considered the go-to Shadow weapon for that stage of the game. Unfortunately, it is significantly more inconvenient to farm the resources needed for it when compared to the Interdimensional Crossbow, making it the go-to meta shadow weapon for the middlegame.  
The Interdimensional Crossbow had a Limited Edition upgrade during the 2017 Great Winter Hunt in the Goldfrost Crossbow Trap. Unfortunately, the Goldfrost Honing Crystal needed to craft this upgrade could only be acquired during this Great Winter Hunt event.

### Alternatives
The Interdimensional Crossbow has an alternative in the Clockwork Portal, which can be acquired in Sandtail Desert.

### Upgrades
After the Interdimensional Crossbow, the next shadow weapon is the [Temporal Turbine](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/shadow/tt), which then upgrades into the [Chrome Temporal Turbine](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/shadow/ctt).
