# Steam Laser
Time to melt some crystalized silver

<mark>Disclaimer:</mark> Usually, pages hosting multiple traps will have the end result mentioned first and go from there. Due to the nature of the Steam Laser traps, this is NOT the case here.

## Steam Laster Mk I

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| __Power__ 	| 4,200 	| __Luck__ 	| 14 	|
| __Power Bonus__ 	| 8% 	|__AttractionBonus__ 	| 0% 	|

| __Acquisition Method__ 	| Trapsmith	| __Cost__ 	| 345,000 gold <br> 4 Wire Spool <br> 4 Heating Oil <br> Frosty Metal	|

### Weapon Acquisition
The Steam Laser Mk. I can be purchased from the Trapsmith in the Slushy Shoreline or the Iceberg for 345,000 gold and 4 of each Wire Spools, Heating Oil and Frosty Metal.
These 3 materials can all be looted from hunting in the Slushy Shoreline while using Softserve charms. They can also drop from the chests rewarded when finishing an Iceberg run fast enough, but that is usually not a usable source at this stage (the Iceberg Strongbox, Supply Chest and Treasure Chest)

## Steam Laster Mk II

- The acquisition method of the Steam Laser Mk. I is described above.
- 4 Bottled Cold Fusions can be acquired from hunting Icewing's Generals in the Iceberg. You should have this number after your first iceberg run.
- 12 Wire Spools, Heating Oils and Frosty Metals can all be looted from hunting in the Slushy Shoreline while using Softserve charms. They can also drop from the chests rewarded when finishing an Iceberg run fast enough, but that is not a consistent source at this stage (the Iceberg Strongbox, Supply Chest and Treasure Chest).
