### Alternatives
This weapon is already an alternative, to the [School of Sharks](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/hydro/csos) which can directly be upgraded into the Chrome School of Sharks. It is generally considered an optional upgrade because they are unlocked at a similar stage of the game, but the significantly higher cost of the School of Sharks and the length to which the Queso Fount Trap can be used gives the weapon a meaningful appeal.

### Upgrades
From the Queso Fount Trap, there is only one upgrade left: the [Chrome School of Sharks](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/hydro/csos). While this upgrade has no direct 'must get before'-points in the game right now, it is the current best in slot Hydro weapon so should be an eventual goal for all hunters.
