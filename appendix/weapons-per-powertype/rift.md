Welcome to the Rifts, the world that is exactely as the world we know but also very much isn't. Rift is the final powertype a hunter will be introduced to, after heading through the Sandtail Desert to face Carmine, an apothecary who tried to harness power beyond her controll. The general idea behind the powertype is to take concepts earlier encountered in the game, but make them a bit different. A big bad burroughs becomes a behemoth, the Acolyte becomes a little more Absolute, and the most hapless mouse of them all transcends reality to become the most powerfull elder of all. These parallels also explain the naming conventions of the areas, with all of them being the name of an existing region followed by 'rift'. Mechanics follow a similar trend, in reinventing mechanics around the same concept as the original areas.
As a powertype, rift doesn't interact all too much with the rest of game. The only place where it really comes back to the rest of the game is in the Prestige base. This base can be acquired in the Valour Rift and outscales any other base in the game by a landslide. Similarly, the first Rift region has to be conquered the hard way with an off-type weapon.
