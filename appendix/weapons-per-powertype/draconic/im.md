### Weapon Acquisition
The Ice Maiden can be bought from the Trapsmith in the Catacombs, the Forbidden Grove, the Acolyte Realm and Dracano for 12 Runes, 1 Frozen Scroll and 1 High Tension Spring Trap.  
- Runes are dropped by various mice in the Forbidden Grove and the Acolyte Realm, primarily when hunting with Ancient Cheese.
- A Frozen Scroll can be obtained from a Mysterious Box, dropped by the Acolyte in the Acolyte Realm. Further details on how to approach this mouse can be found in the [main guide](/legendary-to-knight/hero)

### General Info and Trivia
The Ice Maiden is the first Draconic Weapon a hunter acquires. It is made to beat The Dragon, one of the original three final bosses of the game alongside the Acolyte and Balack, the Banished.
Before the release of Queso Canyon, this weapon carried a hunter from Dracano to Moussu Picchu while giving a love tap to Fluffy the Gargantuamouse in the Fiery Warpath. These days, this path is considered unconventional since the release of the Blazing Ember Spear Trap.

### Alternatives
Draconic doesn't do alternatives.

### Upgrades
After slapping a Dragon and it's underlings with the Ice Maiden, draconic remains unused for quite a while. The next stop would be in Queso Geyser, but before arriving there most hunters will have upgraded to the [Blazing Ember Spear Trap](/appendix/weapons-per-powertype/draconic/best)
