For Novice - Baron, the flow is usually tied by the rank. hence all areas will be on their rank pages. EG Lord page would have all Iceberg, ZT, etc pages there. 

However from Count+, we would be diversifying the pages. Example as follow:
count.md | Main display page for the rank "rank_name.md". Main page will have Table of Content for the children pages.
grift.md | Guide for Grift
queso.md | Guide for Queso (all 4 areas in the Queso Region)
sunkencity.md | Guide for Sunken City

This windmill, and the farm beside it, used to belong to one of Gnawnia's most prosperous farmers before the mice took it over. Windmill mice enjoy the simple life down on the farm, but don't be fooled by their relaxed attitude-- they're laid-back about everything but cheese.

Use Swiss Cheese.

Hunt with Swiss Cheese until you collect 60 Packets of Flour. As you catch more mice, the amount of Flour they drop will increase.

Trade in Packets of Flour for Grilled Cheese. Arm Grilled Cheese to attract Captain Croissant Mouse.

If you miss Captain Croissant, switch back to Swiss Cheese. Repeat the cycle until you catch Captain Croissant Mouse.

Claim the adventure Repair the Windmill after you have caught Captain Croissant Mouse.
Travel to Harbour once you rank up to [Initiate](/novice-to-grandmaster/initiate).
